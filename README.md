### Abstract

2D tileset games, also known as 2D sprite-based games, were popular in the early days of video gaming and are considered to be the predecessors of modern games. These games use 2D graphics to create immersive worlds and characters that players can interact with. They typically feature side-scrolling gameplay, turn-based combat, and a variety of puzzles and challenges.

One of the key features of these games is their use of pre-made tiles to create the game's environments. These tiles are arranged in different patterns to create landscapes, buildings, and other objects. This approach was used in many early games, including Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and it allowed developers to create vast, detailed worlds with limited resources.

These simple games were also influential in the development of game mechanics such as platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Many of these mechanics are still used in modern games, such as the Mario and Zelda franchises, and have been expanded upon to create new gameplay experiences.

Overall, 2D tileset games played a critical role in the development of modern video games, and their influence can still be seen in many of today's most popular titles. While they may be considered retro by some, their impact on the gaming industry is undeniable.

### Our game

The Legend of Pyda is a classic style of top-down role-playing game that uses 2D graphics to create an riveting gaming experience. The game is set in a fantasy world that is made up of different terrains and environments, such as forests, plains, and villages. The player controls a character, allowing them to explore the open world and complete the end goal while racking up experience.

The end goal of the game is to collect as much experience as possible while completing the end goal of rescuing Princess Jasmine from the evil **BAD GUY NAME**. Experience is gained by navigating this world, completing quests, fighting enemies, and collecting items along the way.

The combat mechanics involve Melee and Ranged attacks between Players and Enemies

### Software Architecture Overview

Our game is built using Pygame, a highly portable framework designed for developing video games using the Python programming language. It provides a range of tools and libraries that make it easier to develop and deploy 2D games, including tile-based games. One of the key benefits of Pygame for 2D tileset games is its support for graphics and animation. Pygame provides a set of functions for loading and displaying graphics in various formats, such as PNG, BMP, and JPEG. It also includes tools for manipulating and animating sprites, which are essential for creating the game's characters and objects.
