## Chapter One

### Abstract

2D tileset games, also known as 2D sprite-based games, were popular in the early days of video gaming and are considered to be the predecessors of modern games. These games use 2D graphics to create immersive worlds and characters that players can interact with. They typically feature side-scrolling gameplay, turn-based combat, and a variety of puzzles and challenges.

One of the key features of these games is their use of pre-made tiles to create the game's environments. These tiles are arranged in different patterns to create landscapes, buildings, and other objects. This approach was used in many early games, including Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, and it allowed developers to create vast, detailed worlds with limited resources.

These simple games were also influential in the development of game mechanics such as platforming, exploration, and puzzle-solving. Many of these mechanics are still used in modern games, such as the Mario and Zelda franchises, and have been expanded upon to create new gameplay experiences.

Overall, 2D tileset games played a critical role in the development of modern video games, and their influence can still be seen in many of today's most popular titles. While they may be considered retro by some, their impact on the gaming industry is undeniable.

### Our game

The Legend of Pyda is a classic style of top-down role-playing game that uses 2D graphics to create an riveting gaming experience. The game is set in a fantasy world that is made up of different terrains and environments, such as forests, plains, and villages. The player spawns in a room, where dialogue explains their goals before prompting them to press Y to say yes to the mission. They are then teleported to a plains where they can control a character, allowing them to explore the open world and complete the end goal while racking up experience.

The end goal of the game is to collect as much experience as possible while completing the end goal of rescuing Princess Jasmine from the evil **BAD GUY NAME**. Experience is gained by navigating this world, completing quests, fighting enemies, and collecting items along the way.

The combat mechanics involve Melee and Ranged attacks between Players and Enemies while the player traverses the terrain while collecting items and powerups to increase their chances against the final boss.

### Software Architecture Overview

#### Advantages

Our game is built using Pygame, a highly portable framework designed for developing video games using the Python programming language. 

- **Portability**<br/>
  Pygame is compatible with a range of operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. This makes it easy to develop and distribute your game across multiple platforms.

- **Performance**<br/>
  The framework is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it ideal for creating high-performance games.

- **Simplicity**<br/>
  By having a simple and easy-to-understand API, Pygame makes it easy for beginners to start developing games.

- **Documentation**<br/>
  Pygame has an extensive library of documentation and tutorials, making it easy to learn and troubleshoot any issues you may encounter while developing your game. This library is contributed to by an active community of developers and users, making it easy to find help and support if you need it.

##### Tools and Libraries
Pygame also provides a range of tools and libraries that make it easier to develop and deploy 2D games, including sprite-based games. 

- **Graphic and Animation Support**<br/>
  Pygame provides many inbuilt functions that allow loading and displaying graphics in various formats, such as PNG, TSX, and JPEG. It also includes tools for manipulating and animating sprites, which are used for creating the game's characters and objects.
  
- **Sound Support**<br/>
  Also included in the framework is the ability to add support for sounds such as background music and other sound effects. Some examples of how these sounds can be utilised to enhance user experience are: 

  1. **Feedback**: Developers can add sound effects based on actions ingame such as shooting a gun or attacking an oponent.
  2. **Atmosphere**: Different music can be added to the game at certain points to set the mood of the player, such as calm music while the game is easy and you are exploring the map, or fast paced music while fighting a boss.
  3. **Story**: Dialogue sound effects can be added when intera cting with NPCs to help the user progress through a storyline.

- **Support for Input Devices**<br/>
  Pygame also includes support for input devices, allowing user keystrokes and other inputs to be interpretted by events in real-time. Gameplay can be enhanced by allowing developers to integrate other input devices than a traditional mouse and keyboard, making games accessible to a wider audience.
